        <p>Control, control are you there? This is pilot, can you hear me? copy...?</p>
        <p> ---- THIS CODE: Is suppose to be a push and pull (communication) between 
            the Pilot and the Control. Since, I'm coding alone, I'm  practicing by
            commiting the steps that are suppose to be taken.
